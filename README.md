# Things to Do:

- [x] Get a hosting site for pat3.net
  - [x] Get the website hosted
  WEBSITE IS UP!!!
- [ ] Add classes to HTML
- [ ] Get site to read from styles.css
- [ ] Add color formatting for CSS
- [x] Buy "pat3.net" domain
  - [x] Find a website host - HostGator (I messed up here, I bought the domain through Cloudflare but it turns out not to be a hosting website so I have to host it through Hostgator. Now I have to wait 60 days so I can transfer it to HostGator, or figure out how to route it through the maze that is a DNS server.)
   - [x] Upload site for end users to find
