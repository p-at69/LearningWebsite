            Changelog - Dirty in the Details
        </h1>
        <p class="p">
            You might be asking yourself: <strong>"What is a changelog?"</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            It's simple: a "changelog" is a kind of diary or log of what changes are made - typically to projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            So this is the changelog for my site, to help me learn how to better document my learning experience.

            Massive Style Overhaul
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
        <h3 class="h3">
            This fantastic update is a style overhaul, making it not only better to look at but also better to navigate (which you can also see on this on this page hopefully).
        </h3>    
        <p class="p">    
            CSS development was one of my goals for this website, learning how to style and format text and media to come together cohesively. I think I am closer to achieving that goal now, with this update.
            This change was tricky, allowing styles to interact with one another and not conflict was difficult but not impossible. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This was a good challenge to let me grow my skills. I also learned a bit about troubleshooting, because it is certanly not easy to notice 1 missing character in a file of 10,000 characters. As the saying goes, the devil is in the details.

            Improvements to the homepage and added link to the changelog on hompage.

        <h3 class="h3">
            I edited the welcome page, to make it more structured and appealing.
        </h3>    
        <p class="p">    
            I moved the Instagram link to the top of the page and made it a header to make it easier to see and not so "down there". I also made some style edits, namely bolding the planned improvements and adding a date of last edit.
            <br>
            <br>
            Finally linked the changelog to the homepage for people to access and view!

            This is the first changelog, although the site first went up on 18th, because I had not yet figured out how to make a secondary page on my site. Oh well - live and learn.

            Resources Being Used for Development
        </h3>    
        <p class="p">    
            The resources I am using are very simple as far as coding goes. I am using a 2012 MacBook Pro and 2012 iMac, nothing fancy. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Considering software, I am trying to use only free and opensource tools, to show that anyone can and should be able to make a site on thier own. I am writing this in a IDE called Visual Studio Code (often abbreviated to VS Code) and a few "extentions" as they are called to make my life easier. I am also using GitHub to store my code incase I happen to lose it for some reason, aswell on a external flashdrive.
            <br>
            <br>
            I bought the domain off of the Cloudflare hosting service, but I did this before I realized that it is NOT a hosting service, but rather a CDN (Very different in terms of purpose, mistake on my part.) So I had to shell out more money to a service called HostGator, which actually is a hosting service. This intially caused a issue of not being able to resolve my DNS servers, meaning that no one could see anything on my site. However, with a bit of fumbling around and half-watching a youtube video, we made it through.
